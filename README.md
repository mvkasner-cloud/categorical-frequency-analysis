# Categorical Frequency Analysis

This small learning project demonstrates how to calculate frequency and relative frequency of categorical data using three tools:

- **Excel** (using Pivot Table and formulas compatible with both Excel 365 and older versions)
- **SQL** (SQL Server Management Studio)
- **Python** (pandas in VS Code using Jupyter Notebook)

  ---

## **Data Source & Acknowledgment**
This project is inspired by the course **"Microsoft Excel: Essential Statistics for Data Analysis"** by **Maven Analytics**.
While the initial data structure and analysis questions are based on course materials, all SQL and Python code, additional transformations, visualizations, and analytical steps were independently developed.
The project demonstrates how the same dataset can be analyzed using more advanced tools beyond Excel.

## The analysis includes:
- Counting the number of occurrences for each category
- Calculating relative frequencies
- Adding a **Grand Total** row

| Status           | Frequency | Relative Frequency, % |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Not Placed       | 42        | 44.21                |
| Placed           | 53        | 55.79                |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | 95        | 100.00               |
